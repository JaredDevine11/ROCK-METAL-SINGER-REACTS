# ROCK-METAL-SINGER-REACTS
I will be reacting to anything you guys and gals want to see.   Reactions for individual singers not bands. 1- I will react to vocal quality 2- I will review lyrics and possible meanings 3- I will review the production of the songs   If the reaction is a band.  1- I will react to and review vocals 2 I will react to the individual band members and review the technical aspect of what they are doing 3- I will review the production of the songs.   These are all basics I may or may not do more it depends on the song!  I am a musician and a singer I play multiple insterments and have for many many years. I believe reactions really stop at the first time hearing a band then it becomes reactions to the individual song and a review of the technical capability of the persons and the techniques used.
